<p align="justify"> Welcome to my Training Space for CSS! CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a powerful language used to control the layout and presentation of web pages. It works alongside HTML to define how elements are displayed, including colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning. CSS allows developers to create visually appealing and responsive designs that adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices. By separating content from design, CSS is essential for building modern, user-friendly websites. Its flexibility, combined with advanced features like animations and transitions, makes it a key tool for front-end development.
