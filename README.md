<p align="justify"> CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to control the presentation and layout of web pages. It works alongside HTML to define how elements should appear, including their colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning. CSS enables developers to create visually appealing, responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes and devices. With its ability to separate content from design, CSS is essential for creating modern, user-friendly websites. Its flexibility and extensive features, including animations and transitions, make it a vital tool for front-end development. </p>
